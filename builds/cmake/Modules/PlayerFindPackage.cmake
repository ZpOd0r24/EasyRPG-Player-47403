# PlayerFindPackage
# -----------------
#
# Helper function that conditionally invokes find_package and automatically
# adds targets and compile time definitions.
#
# Required Arguments
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# ``NAME`` (String)
#   Name of the library to search. The name must match FindNAME.cmake.
# ``TARGET`` (list of string)
#   Targets to import when the library was found.
#   Searching ends when any of the targets is found.
#
# Optional Arguments
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# ``CONDITION`` (Bool)
#   When this variable is set to OFF the package is skipped.
#   Allows disabling of libraries via the CMake command line.
# ``DEFINITION`` (String)
#   Preprocessor definition which is set to 1 when the library was found.
# ``REQUIRED`` (without arguments)
#   The library is required. Forwarded to find_package.
# ``VERSION`` (String)
#   Specifies required version of the library.
# ``CONFIG_BROKEN`` (without arguments)
#   Indicates that the config file of the library is known to be broken on
#   certain systems.
#   Uses bundled FindXXX.cmake instead.
# ``ONLY_CONFIG`` (without arguments)
#   Use this for libraries that only have a config file and no find-module.
#   This silences a huge warning emitted by CMake in that case and replaces it
#   with a one-liner.
#
# Return variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# When found the passed ``TARGET`` becomes available.
#
