# EasyRPG Multiplayer Native

Add multiplayer functionality and the server in C++.


## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to create server with podman?

You can use docker, although podman is used in the project.

```
# Change directory
cd EasyRPG-Multiplayer-Native

# Build the image
podman build --build-arg TAG="$(git describe --tags)" -t epmp_img .

# Create the container
podman create --name epmp_container -p 6500:6500 epmp_img

# Start the container
podman restart epmp_container

# Remove the container
podman stop epmp_container && podman rm epmp_container
```

### How to build the Player on the macOS?

The project can be compiled and run on macOS, but the installation of
 icu4c may not match your expectations, and the Opus cannot be enabled.

```
# Install dependencies of liblcf
brew install expat icu4c
brew link icu4c --force

# Install dependencies of Player
brew install libpng libvorbis sdl2 sdl2_mixer pixman freetype

# Build
cmake -B build -DPLAYER_BUILD_LIBS=on -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPLAYER_WITH_OPUS=off
cmake --build build

# If you have problems, you can revert back to previous state
brew unlink icu4c
```

### How to run on Windows?

You can get the precompiled binaries from here:

https://github.com/monokotech/EasyRPG-Multiplayer-Native/releases

The file `Windows-Build-debug-*.zip` is what you need, only the Player.exe is
 needed inside the zip and copy it to the game folder.

### How to make translation work?

Download the master.zip of ynotranslations and extract it:

https://github.com/ynoproject/ynotranslations/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

Find the folder as you need in the ynotranslations and copy that to the game folder,
 and then rename it to `Language`. After that, a new entry will appear in the game menu,
 enter and select language.

If you want to lock the language, you can pass --language \<name\> to the Player, the name
 you want is in the Language folder.

### What is the game folder?

The game folder should include a lot of .lmu files, and may include the RPG\_RT.exe

### How to limit the frame rate?

To enable frame limiter requires to turn off V-Sync.

For older laptops, it is recommended to limit the frame rate below 20fps
 to minimize fan noise.

Press F1 -> Turn V-Sync Off -> Change Frame Limter to 20

### Why doesn't Save Settings work?

The Save Settings will not have any feedback when it is saved, but it outputs
 a log in the terminal with the path of config.ini. In fact, the settings are saved.

Also, the multiplayer settings are included in the config.ini, i.e. you can use
 client commands without the arguments.

### Is there a key to mute or unmute?

Yes, you can press the M key to toggle mute on and off.
